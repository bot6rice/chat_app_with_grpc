# python_grpc_client

This directory is not necessary for the chat app.

But if you prefer python to grpcurl, these python files will be a lot of help of you.

```bash
# If you don't have these packages, run this.
$ pip install pip install grpcio grpcio-tools

# In this directory
$ python main.py
# [stdout]
# Hello
```
